          One of the more expensive, yet beginner projects, I have done is the building of my computer. The process begins the same as most projects - researching the things needed to build it and building it. One of the hardest parts of building anything is finding the best parts for your budget and then making sure they’re compatible. I did about a year of research deciding what parts were best to get. The process of actually building it begins by placing the RAM into the motherboard. Then, you place the CPU into its socket, pull down the lever arm and lock in the CPU cooler. After you’ve locked in your motherboard onto your case, you can install your GPU and your other cards, such as a wifi card. Along with other steps, including wiring and wire management (the second hardest part), the computer is built in about eight hours. This taught me patience and basic electronics, as well as space management in projects. This is my second major engineering experience.
